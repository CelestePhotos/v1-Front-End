# Celeste v1 Front End
<img src="https://celeste.photos/logo_flat.png" alt="Celeste V2 Logo" width="200"/>

# Disclaimer
This is an old version of Celeste. Back from when I was new at web development. I don't suggest using this code exactly, but using it as a way to get started at building your own front-end UI for an image host. I'm mostly posting this because I don't want to repeat the same mistakes as I did back in the day (like not using a framework lol.) Overall this is just a disaster so please use it as a general guide for what to do ONLY IF you have no clue how to implement a feature that we have that you like. Oh and... Remember that some of the code here wasn't written by me but by an ex-developer that I'd rather not name.

# What Is Included?
- Home Page (html, css, js)
- Dashboard (html, css, js)
- CDN Page (css)
- Password Reset Page (html, css, js)
- Login Page (html, css, js)
- Register page (html, css, js)
- Banned Page (html, css)
- Domain List Page (html, css, js)
- All Libraries that we had used for the project

# What Isn't Included?
- All of the backend code *(please read "Why Isn't the Back End Included?" for more information)*
- Staff pages
- The v2 front end (obviously)

# Why Isn't the Back End Included?
Much of the v1 back end is still in use in Celeste v2 (about 1.2k lines of it). I plan to eventually move all of the v1 APIs to rewritten ones but until then, the v1 backend will continue to be closed source. Just because it's closed source doesn't mean that anything shady is going on, I'd just rather not have people combing through it for security issues and exploiting them (you know how this community is). I'll make another repo for the backend at some point down the road.

# Why Are the v1 Staff Pages Excluded too?
We still use the v1 staff page for managing users. Yes, it's horrible. And yes I want to redo it. It takes roughly 45 seconds to load every user on the platform so you aren't missing much.

# Concluding thoughts
Well... with that, I hope that this repo can provide some help to those of you who want to make your own image host front ends. I still suggest using a framework like Vue, Angular, or React but if you'd rather do it in raw HTML, well... have fun! Thanks for showing interest in Celeste and a happy 1 year anniversary (November 18th, 2021).
